Part1 (45/45 points)
	For this part, I implemented the function to create a hybrid image using two aligned images.

Part2 (25/25 points)
	I did show both the fft images before and after low/high passing for the two input images and the result hybrid image.
	And I also showed another two sets of hybrid image cases.

Part 3 (10/10 points)
	Though the Nahito case is flawed, yet I think both the Taiwan president candidate and the superwomen cases are quite good.
	So, for this quality evaluation, I would say I deserve a 10.

Part 4 (20/20 points)
	I've done all the three image enhancement tasks, briefly described what I did and found and displayed the results.

Bells and Whistels (30/30 points)
	I've done the three image enhancement tasks.
	gaussian/laplacian pyramids.
	experiment with colors for hybrid images.
